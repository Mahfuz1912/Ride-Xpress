# Ride Xpress

This project implements a ride-sharing application using Java and potentially interacts with a MySQL database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a recent version of the JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/downloads/
* **MySQL (optional):** If your project uses a MySQL database, you'll need to have MySQL server running on your machine. Download and install from the official MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
* **MySQL Connector/J (optional):** If you're using a MySQL database, download the `mysql-connector-j` library (version 9.1.0 or compatible) from the official MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

### Project Structure (Optional)

**Note:** This section is optional, but it's recommended to organize your project with a clear structure.

* `src/main/java`: This directory typically contains all your Java source code files (e.g., `Start.java`, model classes, etc.).
* `src/test/java`: This directory can be used for your unit tests if you're implementing testing.
* `resources`: This directory can hold any configuration files (e.g., database connection details) or other resources your project needs.

### Running the Application

1. **Compile the Project:** 
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Use a command like `javac -cp .:E:\Class\Project\OOP\Ride\Xpress\mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar Start.java` (modify the path and JAR file name as needed). This will compile your Java source code into class files.

2. **Run the Compiled Code:**
   - After successful compilation, run the application using a command like `java -cp .;"E:\Class Project OOP\Ride Xpress\mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar"Â Start.java `. This will execute the `Start.java` class, which is likely the entry point of your application.

**Additional Considerations:**

* If your project requires database access, ensure you have configured the connection details properly (e.g., in a separate configuration file) and referenced them in your code.
* Adapt the commands for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) if needed. Refer to your system's documentation for command-line syntax adjustments.

## Development Tips

* Use a good code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for better code organization, syntax highlighting, and debugging support.
* Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
* Consider using version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.
* Write clean and well-commented code following Java best practices.
